  <h1 style="color:white;">Variables</h1>
  <p><i style="color:white;">Variables are information holders that can change based on things like user input. Variables consist of data types, and there are 3 we've learned of so far: booleans (these interpret true and false), strings (these consist of meaningful characters), and integers (these are numbers that can be used mathematically, whereas strings can use numbers that won't be used mathematically).</i></p>
  <h1 style="color:white;">Loops</h1>
  <p><i style="color:white;">Loops are added to make certain code repeat a certain amount of times, or repeat forever.</i></p>
  <h1 style="color:white;">Conditionals</h1>
  <p><i style="color:white;">Coditionals are basically if:blank then:blank unless:blank. This means they make a certain function happen at a certain time, until or unless another function occurs.</i></p>
  <h1 style="color:white;">Functions</h1>
  <p><i style="color:white;">Functions allow you to give a name to a set of code that you will use multiple times. So, instead of retyping the code over and over again, you can just type out the name of its function.</i></p>
